## An R package for processing sodium channel data

This R package is designed to process sodium channel data collected in the academic paper called "Substituted cysteine scanning in D1-S6 of the sodium channel hNav1.4 alters kinetics and structural interactions of slow inactivation" by Beard, Shockett, O'Reilly (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2019.183129). It is, however, able to be applied to various data sets. The package is designed for manipulating and evaluating data sets containing mostly continuous data with some categorical data through visualization methods and data evaluation. The functions within include those that can produce bar graphs, scatterplots, and linear models as well as others that can determine the median of numeric data, allow for selection of data based on categorical data, or summarize the numeric data by minimum, maximum, and averages.
